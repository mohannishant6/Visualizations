# Description
This visualization consists of a graphic, which was originally used by nurse, statistician, and reformer Florence Nightingale as a way to explain complex statistics simply, clearly, and persuasively. The areas of the purple, pink and green wedges are each measured from the centre as the common vertex. The purple wedges measured from the centre of the circle represent area for the deaths from Preventable or Mitigable Zymotic Diseases, the pink wedges measured from the center the deaths from wounds, and the green wedges measured from the center the deaths from all other causes. The data has been modified for a better visualization.
